As an undergraduate project, I and my teammates took part in the [CANSAT competition Korea](https://cansat.kaist.ac.kr/e_index.php) in 2016. Our primary mission was to track a target on the ground by a gimbaled camera while descending from 500m altitude and compute cansat's position relative to the target to imitate a planetary landing mission. I was involved in programming for a [gimbal stabilizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVIxHL-qj1Y&t=0s) in MCU, vision processing for position computation, and ground station GUI.

We won [the second prize](https://cansat.kaist.ac.kr/em04_05) in the competition !
