For a future mission of Lunar surface exploration by a Korean rover, our team, Navigation and Electronic System LAB at Seoul National University, developed a visual-inertial navigation system that is based on the seminal work of [Mourikis and Roumeliotis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4209642). This work was sponsored by the Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea. 

We tested our system in simulated environments, datasets collected by a MAV and a car. We also built a rover platform to gather stereo images, IMU readings, and RTK GPS module for the ground-truth for field testing.
