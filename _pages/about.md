I am a postdoc at the [Smart Robotics Lab](https://srl.cit.tum.de/home), Technical University of Munich, Germany. My research background is state estimation for robotics.

I have a strong interest in mobile robotics, particularly in the fields of Spatial AI and autonomous exploration. My goal is to build smarter and safer robots for real-world applications by developing practical and robust software and algorithms grounded in strong theoretical foundations.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
